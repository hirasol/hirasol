    <p>My favourite CMSC subject so far is CMSC 130: Logic Design and Digital Computer Circuits. I enjoy making diagrams and logic circuits because they feel like doing a fun logic puzzle for me.</p>
    <p>My favourite GE so far is Comm 10 because it is very essential and our topics are very relevant to the current news climate, such as political rhetoric.</p>
    <p>I have enjoyed Javascript the most so far because it's quite intuitive but you can still accomplish many things with it. I prefer object-oriented languages in general.</p>
    <p>I love spicy food and food with many different ingredients in general, and pizza is an example!</p>
